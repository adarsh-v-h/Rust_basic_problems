unlike other question, this is a bit tricky, here we have to see a song, understand the pattern and then create a code to print out the whole song. The song given is "The 12 days of christmas", here is the song.

Here we have a total of 12 gifts and 12 days, the first day starts with 1 gift and by second day we have both the first day's and second day's gift, so on 12th day we have to give 12 gifts, all that are from first day till 12th. And the gifts should be in reverse, the first day's gift should be last on the next day's gift in the lyrics
